    <p><strong> August 8, 2025 </strong></p>
    <p>We’ve added a small info box about copyright and usage guidelines for uploaded media.<BR>
    Users can now delete their own uploads - including videos!</p>

        <p><strong>📢 Update – 2025-08-02 </strong></p>
        <p>
          The folder system has been cleaned up and simplified! 🧹 Categories now appear directly on the gallery page — no need to click through folders. You can still choose from several preset categories when uploading, or create your own via “Other”. Everything’s working smoothly now — thanks for your patience! 💛
        </p>

        <p><strong>Heads up! – 2025-08-01 </strong></p>
        <p>
          Our folder system is still a bit quirky 🗂️ Tried creating a new category by selecting “Other” – but the folder ended up being called “Other” instead of the name I typed <strong> :D </strong>
          I’m working on making the gallery easier to navigate, so if you have ideas or suggestions, please pop them in the Æ-Chat ↓ I’d love to hear them! 💬 💡
        </p>

        <p><strong>Video Upload Update – 2025-07-28 </strong></p>
        <p>
          We now have a functioning video upload feature <em>(which appears to work!)</em>.
          The plan is... to eventually implement a comment system and Emoji reactions: like, laugh, cry, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the best, Pia
        </p>

        <p><strong>🦅📚 Archive Update 2025-07-12</strong></p>
        <p>Hi friends — just popping in with a little update from behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>While working on the Æapp earlier today, I made a small mistake while cleaning up timestamps... and accidentally cleared out <em>maaaany</em> of our beautiful archived comments. I know, I know <strong>:D</strong> - I'm truly sorry. Each message meant something, and I'm sad they've flown away.</p>
        <p>But! The app still works perfectly and new comments are already being saved again. I promise extra care going forward — and thank you so much for your kindness, patience, and wonderful presence here.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:10px;">With all my warmth, Pia </p>
